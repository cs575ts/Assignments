For each of the dataset you need to do the following tasks:
Compute the KPSS and ADF test and comment on the stationariety of the Dataset
If its not stationery, then make it stationery by differencing or other methods.
*Appply the following algorithms
Single, double and triple Exponential Smoothing for all the three datasets as provided. Do not use the built in libraries, use the ones you developed for the previous assignment.
Only AR
Only MA
ARIMA
SARIMA (if the data has seasonality)

There is an excel file provided "Make Such a Table for every Dataset in Jupyter", make such a table in the ipynb notebook

The dataset does not have time column, so you can assume a serialized time from 1 to n. (1 unit .. to n unit)

You can choose and try different values of alpha, beta, gamma and provide those values of alpha, beta, gamma for which the MSE for the least. Similarly for AR/MA/ARIMA models, try out different combinations and mention the optimal one. You can use auto-arima.
Plot the MSE for the constructed table.
